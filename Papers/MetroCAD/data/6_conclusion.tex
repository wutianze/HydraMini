\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present the design, implementation, characteristics and case studies of HydraMini, an affordable experimental research and education platform for autonomous driving. The platform is highly flexible and extensible, full stack, and easy-to-use. These three characteristics help users understand AD technology well and take full advantage of HydraMini. Students and researchers could use our platform for full-stack researches on algorithms, applications, system, mechanical control and hardware acceleration. We hope this platform helps users enjoy their research and learning process without paying much.
